# BROKEN
Broken since Hyper migrated from `hterm` to `xterm.js`. Sadly it's not an easy fix, but hopefully I'll get to fixing it at some point.

# RobCo™ Vault Terminal Adaptation Program™ (VTAP)
_Still using that out-of-date, silent terminal? Wishing your machine clicked like the rest? Prepare For The Future™ and upgrade today for FREE!*_

_*VaultTec vault subscription required._

This [Hyper](https://hyper.is) extension adds some of the terminal sound effects found in [Fallout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)) [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3)/[NV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas), making your 21st century shell feel as clicky as the games' 23rd century computers. Looks best with a retro theme like `hyperpunk`.

## Install
For now, you need to `git clone` this repository into `~/.hyper_plugins/local/hyper-robco` and add `hyper-robco` to `localPlugins` in `.hyper.js`.
